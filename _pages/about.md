Hello! I am a first-year PhD student at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu), studying mathematics. I previously did my undergraduate degree at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu), where I graduated with a triple major in mathematics, data science, and computational science, with minors in computer science, economics, and music (a list of relevant coursework can be found [here](/courses)). I did my senior thesis under [Dr. Rachel Petrik](https://sites.google.com/view/rachelpetrik/home), where I investigated diagonal forms over finite fields.

Feel free to contact me at chen5591 &lt;at&gt; purdue &lt;dot&gt; edu.

## Interests

Due to the many great professors I met in undergrad with varying backgrounds, I became interested in many more branches of mathematics than I expected. As a result, my mathematical interests are very broad and scattered (as evidenced by my triple major), but my primary interests would be algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. Other various math subjects I am also interested in are convex optimization, numerical analysis, and the mathematics of machine learning, but I've enjoyed pretty much every branch of mathematics I have encountered so far. While not quite mathematics, I'm also interested in statistics, data analytics, and machine learning (especially image recognition).
