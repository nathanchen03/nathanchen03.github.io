## Friends

Several of my math friends that I owe much of my mathematical learning and development over the years also have websties of their own, which you should also explore:

## Indiana Collegiate Mathematics Competition

While I was at Rose-Hulman, I competed in the [Indiana Collegiate Mathematics Competition (ICMC)](https://www.indiana.maa.org/icmc) each year from 2023 to 2025, being part of the winning team each time. I had great teammates every time!

## Music

I play a variety of instruments (although probably not very well). I grew up playing piano and still enjoy playing whenever I have time. I played clarinet for concert band and orchestra, most recently for the Rose-Hulman Symphony Orchestra and the Rose-Hulman Concert Band. I started teaching myself how to play guitar during COVID, and also taught myself trumpet to join jazz band in middle school.

## Video Games

I am a fan of competitive strategy games. The game I played the most is Hearthstone, where I regularly hit the top 200 leaderboard (or at least I used to). I also used to do data analytics for hearthstone data using data sites like [hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net) and [hsguru.com](https://hsguru.com) to optimize decks (my interest in statistics and data analytics in fact came from trying to get higher ranks in hearthstone, luckily this is a very transferrable and useful skill).

 I also played Teamfight Tactics for a few sets, hitting masters in those (sets 9 and set 11).
